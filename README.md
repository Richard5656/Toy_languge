# Toy_languge
It is a toy language I wrote poorly in C++.

To use read the documentation.

Requirements:
  G++

To build cd into src and type make.
Binaries will show up in bin.

<pre>Note: Only works on windows and linux.
Also is very buggy.

The virtual machine architecture is based off of <a href = "https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter">Lotabout's how to write a C interpreter </a>
(Linux currently unsupported)
